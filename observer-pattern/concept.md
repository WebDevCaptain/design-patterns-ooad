The *Observer design pattern* is a `behavioral design pattern` where an object (called the Subject) maintains a list of dependents (called Observers) and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. 

> This pattern is commonly used to implement distributed event-handling systems.

* Example-1: We'll create a weather station (subject) that notifies display devices (observers) when the temperature changes.
